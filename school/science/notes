Physical Changes vs Chemical Changes 
	-	Physical Change
		- Change in appearance or form. Same makeup before and after
		- Ex. - Is it soluable meaning going from pure salt and water to them mixing
	- Chemical Change 
		- Chemical reactions 
		- Reactivity; difference substances form
		- Ex. - Iron rusting, baking cookies

	- Evidence of Chemical Change * Irreversible:
		- 1. Color / Odor Change
		- 2. Gas Released (bubbles)
		- 3. Energy (often heat) Released or Absorbed
		- 4. Precipitate forms. (isoluble solid)

Chemical Reactions -
	-	Reactants------------Products
	- Hydrogen + Oxygen -> Water
	- Iron + Oxygen -> Iron Oxide

	- Law of Conservation of Mass -> Mass of Reactants = Mass of Products
	
The Periodic Table - 
	- 118 elements - arranged by increasing atomic number 
	- Vertical = groups or families
		- Similar Properties
	- Horizontal = Periods
		- The Higher period elements are on, the more reactive they are.

Density	
	- Density Formula -> D = M/V

Corn Syrup has a density of 1.36 g/mL. Express this value in dg/L - 
	- 1.36 g	 10  dg		1000mL   13,660 dg/L
		------ X ------ X ------ = ------
		1   mL	 1    g		1 L      
	
Manganese has a density of 7.21g/mL. What is its density in cg/L
	- 7.21 g	 100 cg		1000mL
		------ X ------ X ------ = 721,000 cg/L
		1   mL	 1    g		1		 L 

If you have a 2.75 kg sample of mercury, what is its volume in mL? (Mercury has a density of 13.6 g/mL)
	-	2.75 kg X 1000g X 1 mL
							-----   ----- = 202 mL
							1  kg		13.6g
