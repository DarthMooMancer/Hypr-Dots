Physical Changes vs Chemical Changes 
	-	Physical Change
		- Change in appearance or form. Same makeup before and after
		- Ex. - Is it soluable meaning going from pure salt and water to them mixing
	- Chemical Change 
		- Chemical reactions 
		- Reactivity; difference substances form
		- Ex. - Iron rusting, baking cookies

	- Evidence of Chemical Change * Irreversible:
		- 1. Color / Odor Change
		- 2. Gas Released (bubbles)
		- 3. Energy (often heat) Released or Absorbed
		- 4. Precipitate forms. (isoluble solid)

Chemical Reactions -
	-	Reactants------------Products
	- Hydrogen + Oxygen -> Water
	- Iron + Oxygen -> Iron Oxide

	- Law of Conservation of Mass -> Mass of Reactants = Mass of Products
	
The Periodic Table - 
	- 118 elements - arranged by increasing atomic number 
	- Vertical = groups or families
		- Similar Properties
	- Horizontal = Periods
		- The Higher period elements are on, the more reactive they are.

Density	
	- Density Formula -> D = M/V
