Dear Mom, 
	Life in the United States is rough and not much better than back at home. 
	I left because of our circumstances at home with the famine and how poor 
	we were. I am not living on the streets anymore and I have food, but I face 
	a lot of discrimination here. I came here because I thought there would be less 
	discrimination against me because I am Jewish, but they still treat me badly. 
	There are more jobs here to work for; however, because of my paralysis I can't 
	do a lot of jobs because they require to arms. However, I have a lot of freedom
	to walk around and do things without being beat or hurt because of my religion like
	back at home.
	
	Life at Ellis Island is terrible because I am illiterate and unskilled. I need to learn English 
	quickly, and try to hide my arm. While the discrimination is bad due to my condition,
	at least I have a lot of job opportunites and a chance at a new life that may get better
	over time. 

	My goal once I get to the Mainland is to get to New Jersey and start my new life there. 
	I have a lot of work before I can get there and life properly. 

														Sincerely,
															Simon
